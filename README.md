# Predicting_Stroke
In this project I have developed a simple predictor for stroke in healthcare patients, based on real-world data. The idea is to develop a few ideas on how to deal with medical data and possible unbalances, biases and distortions due to the way the data has been collected and structured. In the first version of the project I due some quick data exploration and cleaning/feature engineering, with the aim of quickly producing a predictor. Further work could be done on the feature selection, on modularisation, code cleaning and ultimately on the predicting model optimisation.

## Data description
Each patient is characterised by the following variables:

## Data exploration
In this section I check the variables's distribution and balancing. Some imbalances withing features are found, e.g. on heart disease and hypertension occurrence, but it would not be realistic to expect a balanced distribution in a random population sample.

The target variable _stroke_ is however very unbalanced, and that would likely cause the predictor to ignore the minority class.
